I am a Smalltalk, Ruby and Ruby on Rails developer who has a strong interest in software design and architecture. I also coach developers on TDD, software design and architecture.

Prior to becoming a software engineer, I was a physicist at UCL. My undergraduate degree is an MSci in Theoretical Physics, and my [PhD is in Physics](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/19432/). My area of research was on electron-molecule collisions using the [R-Matrix method, developed by Wigner and Eisenbud in 1947](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-matrix). You can read the full article from the references therein. It was through my PhD that I became a programmer, beginning with JAVA.

From 2012 I transitioned to Ruby and Ruby on Rails which is my main language of development. Later, around 2017, I began working with Pharo Smalltalk, contributing to the mathematics library [PolyMath](https://github.com/PolyMathOrg/PolyMath), thanks to my former mentor [Tim Mackinnon](https://github.com/macta).
